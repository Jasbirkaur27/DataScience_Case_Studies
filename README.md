# Data Science & Analytics Case Studies
This repository showcases a collection of my data science and analytics projects across different tools and platforms. The projects include tasks I have completed as part of my fellowship at DataPlay, where I applied various data analysis techniques, predictive modeling, and data visualization using Excel, Power BI, and SQL. These projects cover diverse areas such as predictive modeling, gender prediction, loan data analysis, market basket analysis, and more.

## Projects Overview
**Titanic Dataset Prediction in Excel**

Built a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to predict survival rates based on different features.The analysis involved data transformation, creating pivot tables, and applying basic statistical techniques. Performance evaluation was done to assess model accuracy, all within Excel."
