# Google reviews analysis 
### Overview
I have done this project as a part of my fellowship at dataplay. In this analysis google reviews of students or interns at  dataplay is analyized to make a word cloud that too using excel.Main aim of project is to do a kind of text analysis in excel without using any advanced programming language like python (NLP).By doing this in excel detailed view of how text analysis is done in python is studied by applying various steps manually.

**Dataset**<br>
The dataset was provided by company and it has a column named google reviews where reviews by people are written in a single word or a line. <br>
Main Steps involved :<br>
- Getting all reveiws in a single column for better view and analysis. 
- Text to column : To split reviews into single word ( as tokenization does in NLP).
- Pivot table : For counting frequence of each word.
- Removing stopwords

**Highlights**<br>
Apart from doing this analysis in Excel only i have done this in Python too. Main points of Excel are uploaded in my pdf and you can also view my linkedin post : <br> <link>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasbir-k-2464ab24b_google-reviews-activity-7291300871215140864-1Kew?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD3U1ZYBGj8Nnr47v7A1stE4ItAGzqGjufc</link>
